# Interactive_Cheatsheets

Compilable, interactive glossaries for various programming languages I use often with lot's of comments. These are meant for quick referencing and experimentation and are in no way a substitute for the actual documentations for a given language.

Languages currently covered:

- C++
- Python
- Ruby
